Jitsi Meet is an `open-source`_ video-conferencing application.  It looks a lot like other video-conferencing tools you may have used in the past, such as `Zoom`_, `Google Meet`_, or `Microsoft Teams`_.  Some things will look a bit different, and there will be slightly different-looking icons to click on, but the basic idea is the same.  Once you have used it a few times, you won't notice the difference.

Why Jitsi?
----------

Zoom, Google Meet, and others do a good job.  They are easy to use and reliable, with world-spanning reach.  However, most of these applications are closed-source and run by for-profit companies.  A good and ancient rule of thumb for the Internet is that "when the product is free, *you* are the product."

Jitsi does not work like that.  In addition to the code itself being open source, free to look at and change, your personal information will not be harvested.  Even better, you can set up Jitsi on your own server so that you are able to control the flow of information yourself.

For some organizations, anonymity of the participants in a meeting is important.  You do not need to set up an account to use Jitsi, and at least in my particular setup, your IP address is saved only for the length of the meeting and then discarded.

The particular incarnation of Jitsi discussed here is being run on one of my own private servers.  At the moment (11/25/2020) it lives on a virtual private server in New Jersey managed by `Linode`_.  But it will likely move around and the portability of the application is another attraction.  If you want (and know your way around Linux), you can set up a Jitsi server for your own use following the guide `here`_.
