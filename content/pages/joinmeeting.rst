The easiest way to join a meeting, for most people, will be to use your web browser.  At this moment, the browser that works the best is Google Chrome.

You will have been given a link to the meeting, which might look something like this: ``https://meet.fob.monster/pinegrove``

Paste or type this link into the address bar.
